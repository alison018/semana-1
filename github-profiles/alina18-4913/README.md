# Hi I am Alison
### In my 30s decided to change careers and I am here to learn üöÄ


I have been learning **programming** for the past fourth months. It has been a roller coaster of emotions for the past months. But I keep my will and determination up. I am learning **JavaScript** and I will start creating my *Porfolio*.

I will be learning a bunch of stuff in Undefined academy for the next 16 months. Some of the topics are as follows:

- Git and Github
- Configuration of the development environment (Prework)
- The world of Markdown
- Introduction to HTML and CSS
- JavaScript 101
- JSON, DOM and CSSOM
- Basic project structure
- UI Frameworks
- JavaScript Libraries
- SQL databases
- Introduction to servers
- Continuous Integration
